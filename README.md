Hi, I am Andrew. I am new to GitHub. I have not been coding for years. Now, I want to learn how to become a Web Developer for fun on the side. If this will land me a job working from home. I will be ecstatic. But right now, I have a full time ministry as a hospice chaplain. If you happen, to open this readme file and read this. I would love to know what you are doing with GitHub and your passion in life.
